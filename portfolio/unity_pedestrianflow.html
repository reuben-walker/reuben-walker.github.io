        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <br>
        Using Unity, I simulated pedestrian flow around the transportation centre at Simon Fraser University. The area being studied has a high
        volume of pedestrians, as people move to/from the transit stops, as well as moving between different classes. Students are represented
        by "agents", which can navigate to their destination while avoiding collisions with other agents. <br><br>

          <a href="Portfolioitems/navmesh/Picture1.png"><img class="flex-img" src="Portfolioitems/navmesh/Picture1.png" alt="Area setup" width="600"></a>
          <div class="portfolio-itemdesc">
            The top level of the structure has 8 differently-colored destination markers, representing places that different students might want to go.
            On the ground level, there is a brown destination marker that represents the pick-up bay for the bus stop.
            Near the bottom of the image there is a crowd of students who just got off the bus, and are standing in the drop-off bay. 
            All of the "students" are colored by their destination. Note that none of the students who just got dropped off the bus are headed 
            for the pick-up bay, and none of the students are trying to go to the same side of the structure from which they came.

        There are a few aspects of the agent's behavior that do not reflect real-world pedestrian behavior:
        <ul>
          <li>Many of the agents crossing from one side of the top level to the other didnâ€™t show any aversion 
            to walking up or down stairs. In real life, many people would opt to take one of the side walkways to 
            avoid going up or down stairs.</li>
          <li>Agents tended to take the straightest path to their destination without looking ahead. Real people 
            might spot crowds from a distance and opt to take a less crowded path instead of taking a more direct,
            but crowded route.</li>
          <li>The NavMesh was set up assuming that students would only cross the road at designated crosswalks
            or crossing point. In reality, many people jaywalk.</li>
          <li>What individuals are able to see would impact their decisions. For example, people at the top of stairs 
            could make more informed decisions about where to navigate than people turning around a blind corner.</li>
          </ul>
