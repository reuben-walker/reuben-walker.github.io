        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <br>

        The poster describes the process of using image enhancements in PCI Catalyst to allow the viewer to distinguish
        between old growth and new growth forests in Landsat-8 imagery of southwestern Vancouver Island. Here is an additional summary of the process:<br>

        <div class="portfolio-item">
          <a href="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/clip_2.png"><img class="flex-img" src="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/clip_2.png" alt="RGB Composite" height="400"></a>
          <div class="portfolio-itemdesc">
            This is the standard RGB composite image of the study area. In this image, the new-growth and old-growth forested areas are harder to tell apart. 
            Old-growth forested areas appear slightly darker, but the shadows from the mountainous terrain make the distinction difficult. The goal of 
            the image enhancement would be to make the old-growth and new-growth forests easier to visually discern, and to 
            reduce the effect of the shadows from the mountains.

        <div class="portfolio-item">
          <a href="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/unenhanced_composite.png"><img class="flex-img" src="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/unenhanced_composite.png" alt="654 Composite" height="400"></a>
          <div class="portfolio-itemdesc">
            First, a 654 band composite was applied to the image. (Note: this project used Landsat-8 data, so this would be a 543 composite 
            if using Landsat-7 or earlier) The band composite was chosen because spectral analysis revealed that old-growth 
            and new-growth forested areas had a different spectral response in bands 5 and 6 (NIR and SWIR1) which could help
            the viewer distinguish between the two land cover types.

          <a href="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/stan.png"><img class="flex-img" src="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/stan.png" alt="Square root enhancement" height="400"></a>
          <div class="portfolio-itemdesc">
            Next, a standard square root enhancement was applied to the image. This image enhancement stretches values in the lower end 
            of the range, making them brighter overall as well as more distinguishable from each other. This helps distinguish shadowed
            areas from water, as well as making the different types of forest cover easier to distinguish. However, this enhancement could
            still benefit from more contrast between the different forested areas.

          <a href="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/cust.png"><img class="flex-img" src="Portfolioitems/image_enhancements/cust.png" alt="Custom enhancement" height="400"></a>
          <div class="portfolio-itemdesc">
            Finally, a custom image enhancement was applied to the image. This custom enhancement differs from the square root enhancement
            in that an adaptive enhancement is applied to the NIR band, which is mapped to green. This enhancement was chosen for this channel
            because the old-growth and new-growth forested areas display the most difference in this band. The resulting image displays old-growth
            forest as a dark purplish green, and new-growth forested areas as a lighter green.
