                    My name is Reuben Walker. I am currently a student in the Geographic Information Systems 
                    graduate certificate program at NSCC COGS, in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia. 
                    I am originally from Vancouver, British Columbia.<br><br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy cooking, camping, riding my bike, making electronic music, drawing, and reading comics. 
                    I also enjoy keeping shrimp in an aquarium, but I had to get rid of it when I moved. In the future, 
                    I want to have an aquarium again, as well as a vegetable garden and a couple of dogs. My dream vacation is to travel to Japan.<br><br>
                    I'm interested in making cities in North America more walkable and bikeable, and with expanding public transit.
                    I want to use GIS technology to help plan better cities, help expand the amount of affordable housing, and to help protect the environment.
